# In-A-Giffy
In A Giffy is a Python CLI tool that uses FFmpeg to convert between MP4 and GIF.

## Note
In A Giffy does _not_ come with FFmpeg pre-installed, you need to download the build from [this](https://github.com/absolllute/ffmpeg-build) repo. Even though the repo readme is mainly for geometry dash, the build should work for all usecases.
Or alternatively, simply run `python main.py -s` which will ask you for custom ffmpeg.exe path (by default it chooses the current repository)
